      I don't particularly have any projects, considering that what I've done for the most part is through the company, but I have worked on a university project with a fellow student.
      Technically still in progress, it is a visual novel game using Ren'Py, where I undertook some roles including character design, management of said project, and fleshing out
      parts of the dialogue and code.
